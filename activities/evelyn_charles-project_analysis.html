					<h2>Site Intent</h2>
					<p> The purpose of this redesign is to improve the visual appeal and usability of the State of Florida's Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles website. The current version of the website is quite cluttered and does not offer the user an intuitive way for them to successfully obtain or renew their Florida's Driver's Licence.</p>
					<p> The Next Dimension Web Design Studio, under the direction and leadership of it's owner, Charles K. Evelyn, has been assigned with the redesign by the client with the intent of accomplishing the following:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Determining and identifying the target audience</li>
						<li>Focus on user intentions</li>
						<li>Reconsolidate or reorganize site content</li>
						<li>Incorporate the principles of Responsive Design</li>
						<li>Ensure cross browser compatibility across modern browsers</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Upon conclusion of the project analysis and the content audit of the FHSMV website, visitors and potential users will reap the benefits of:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>An enhanced user experience when attempting to renew their Florida driver's licence</li>
						<li>Quickly identifying and uploading the necessary forms needed in the identification process</li>
						<li>Having the ability to interact with the FHSMV website from the web browser of their choice</li>
						<li>Accessing the FHSMV website from the a variety of web enabled devices that include:
							<ul>
								<li>desktop computers</li>
								<li>tablets</li>
								<li>mobile devices</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
