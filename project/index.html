						<h2>Department Overview</h2>
							<p>
							At the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV), we come into contact with nearly every Floridian as well as many visitors to our state.
							People get a driver license to operate their vehicles or for photo identification purposes. They register and title their automobiles, mobile homes, and boats. They may receive assistance from the Florida Highway Patrol if they are involved in a crash or their vehicle breaks down along Florida's highways. Often the Patrol will remind drivers to slow down and buckle up.
							There is more to DHSMV than meets the eye. Our mission is to provide highway safety and security through excellence in service, education and enforcement. Our department members around the state are dedicated to accomplishing this mission. You may be surprised by some of the duties we perform and the numerous on-line services now available.
							Visit our home page at www.flhsmv.gov for more information on all that DHSMV can do for you.
